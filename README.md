# Game Engine

Game engine is a tools available for game designers to code out a game quickly and easily without building one from the ground up. This game engine is a 2D based using JavaFX.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Requirements

The Game Engine requires the following to run:

-   [Java](https://www.java.com/fr/download/)
-   [JavaFX](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javafx/overview/index.html)

### Building

A step by step examples to help you initialize the game engine for your project.

The first step is to extends from GameApp.

```java
public class YourGame extends GameApp {

}
```

The second step is to override several methods:

-   The initSetting
-   The initLevel
-   The initGameObject
-   The initInput
-   The initCamera
-   The initParticle
-   The initUI
-   ...
